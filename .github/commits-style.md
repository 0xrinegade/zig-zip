# Commit style guide 
We value transparency and readability. Maintaining a consistent and clear structure of commits is a priority for us.

## Commit template
You can create a commit like this:
```sh
<type of update>(<updated file/component/feature>): <additional description>
```

You can use any of the following items for the type of the update:
- `feat`
- `fix`
- `remove`
- `refactor`
- `chore`
- `rel`

To give more detail about your commit, declare the file or feature you updated in parentheses.

For example:
- `index.html`
- `Button.svelte`
- `trade`
- `transaction`

State and additional description about what you have changed or why you did it. Stay between from 1 to 50 characters!
